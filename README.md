# Workout-Tracker (Nosql)


## Objective:

Create an app that tracks daily workouts by logging multiple exercises in a workout. The user is able to select resistance training and track the total weights lifted, the number of sets and reps and the total duration of their exercise. Also if the user selects cardio they will be able to track their distance traveled as well.


## Details:

The user is able to :

* Select their 'exercise type'.

* Add exercises to their most recent workout plan.

* View their combined weight of multiple exercises from the past number of workouts on the dashboard/stats page.
